# Objective-C ARC and Core Foundation Memory Management Conflict

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Objective-C related to memory management when using Core Foundation objects within an ARC environment.  Improper use of `CFRetain` and `CFRelease` can lead to crashes or memory leaks due to incorrect reference counting.  The solution demonstrates the correct approach to handling these objects.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in incorrectly managing the reference count of Core Foundation objects.  Releasing an object multiple times or failing to release it when done results in unpredictable behavior.

## Solution
The solution focuses on diligently tracking the reference counts of CF objects and utilizing appropriate bridging techniques to seamlessly integrate them into ARC-managed code.

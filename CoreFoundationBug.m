In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises when dealing with memory management and the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and Core Foundation objects.  Specifically, this involves using `CFRetain` and `CFRelease` within ARC-managed code, which often leads to unexpected crashes or memory leaks if not handled meticulously. For example:

```objectivec
CFStringRef cfString = CFStringCreateWithCString(kCFAllocatorDefault, "Hello, world!", kCFStringEncodingUTF8);
// ... some operations using cfString ...
CFRelease(cfString); // Correctly releases the Core Foundation object
```

The problem occurs when developers inadvertently retain or release these objects multiple times, creating an imbalance in reference counts or, worse, releasing an object that's already been released (double release). This is particularly subtle when multiple threads or asynchronous operations are involved.  Incorrectly managing these objects can lead to crashes with cryptic error messages, making debugging difficult.
